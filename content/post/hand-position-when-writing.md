After a lot of typing my wrist started to hurt.
So I done some research and found out that the best way
to have you hand when typing is without resting your palms
on you keyboard, basically keep your elbows up like a
piano player...because in the long run can cause 
fatigue and also other wrist problems. After testing this 
method I am quite happy with the result and I will try to
implement it more and more :smiley:.
